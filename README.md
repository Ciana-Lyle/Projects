# Projects

So far, I have included two projects. One is a personal project called Eurovision Placement Calculator, which takes Eurovision results going from 2010 to 2024 and calculates a placement based on country, year, and genre (optional). The second project is a GAN that takes in this dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) of around 87,000 images of ASL signs and gives a generated picture based on an inputted letter or word.
